# Mario Reinforcement Learning

## Single-Threaded Version

The single-threaded implementation achieved the following results:

- After about 2 million iterations, it occasionally beats level 1-1 of Super Mario Brothers.
- At 4 million iterations, it consistently beats level 1-1.
- After 5 million iterations, it flawlessly completes level 1-1.

## "Multi-Threaded" Implementation

Currently, the multi-threaded implementation is not true multithreading. It can be likened to assigning 8 individuals to perform the same task simultaneously. True multi-threading involves a team of 8 people collaborating on the task.
